BUGS:
When entering polygon command, excessive backspacing will cause invalid vertex format warning, just need to reenter string
Rotate and scaling lines seg faults, dont do it please!
Sometimes program will hang and appear to not respond to input, just try hitting enter in command line


Sutherland Hodgman is supposed to return count so you know how long the vertex array is, also need to initialize arrays before passing in
